# Full Stack Food Ordering Website 

This project is a complete food ordering website/app developed using a powerful tech stack that includes React JS for the frontend, MongoDB for the database, Express and Node JS for the backend server, and Stripe for the payment gateway. The application includes a frontend website, admin panel, and backend server. It features a user authentication system, allowing users to create accounts and log in securely to the food ordering website.

The frontend part of the project has been completed using React JS, providing a seamless and interactive user interface where customers can browse the menu, add food items to their cart, and place orders. The shopping cart functionality allows users to manage their selected items efficiently, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience. The backend development involves setting up a robust server using Node JS and Express, and connecting it to a MongoDB database to store user and order data. This setup ensures that the application is scalable and capable of handling a large number of users and orders.

Additionally, the project integrates the Stripe payment gateway, enabling secure and convenient online payments for orders placed through the app. Features to update order statuses are also implemented, providing real-time feedback to users about their order progress. This project covers essential full-stack development skills, resulting in a fully functional and professional food ordering application. Upon completion of the backend part, the system will be complete and ready for deployment.
