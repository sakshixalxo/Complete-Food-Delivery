# Full Stack Food Ordering Website 


This project is a complete food ordering website/app developed using a powerful tech stack that includes React JS for the frontend, MongoDB for the database, Express and Node JS for the backend server, and Stripe for the payment gateway. The application includes a frontend website, admin panel, and backend server. It features a user authentication system, allowing users to create accounts and log in securely to the food ordering website.

The frontend part of the project has been completed using React JS, providing a seamless and interactive user interface where customers can browse the menu, add food items to their cart, and place orders. The shopping cart functionality allows users to manage their selected items efficiently, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience. The backend development involves setting up a robust server using Node JS and Express, and connecting it to a MongoDB database to store user and order data. This setup ensures that the application is scalable and capable of handling a large number of users and orders.
